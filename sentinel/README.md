## Checkers

### Health Checker

Calls health check URLs regularly and sends an alarm if the service is not alive.

- Prerequisites

Ensure that JSON files are correctly defined in `./pkg/checker/health`.
The JSON file containing the health check URL can be generated by running the `./script/collect-healthcheck-urls` script.

```sh
go run ./script/collect-healthcheck-urls --chain={CHAIN} --kubeconfig={PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG} --context={K9S_CONTEXT}
```

Default values are as follows:

```sh
chain = "baobab"
kubeconfig = "/Users/${USER}/.kube/config"
contextName = "orakl-baobab-admin@bisonai"
```

### Balance Checker

Reads Orakl service wallets regularly and sends an alarm if the amount is less than the minimum.

### Event Checker (TBD)

Reads events from the Graphnode DB and sends an alarm message if the expected event is not emitted after the expected time.
